# PS, this class is just the fucking worst. I have no problem with things being difficult, but they aren't difficult for the right reasons;
# they're difficult because the instruction is poor, hardly related to the assignments, rushed, and the concepts aren't explained at all.
# When the best learning you're getting out of a class is from googling shit, why the fuck are we taking this class? It adds no value.
